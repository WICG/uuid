# uuid

This repository formerly hosted the incubation efforts for the [`crypto.randomUUID()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Crypto/randomUUID) method. The specification has now been upstreamed into the larger [Web Crypto specification](https://w3c.github.io/webcrypto/#Crypto-method-randomUUID), and so our work here is done!

You can view [previous revisions of this repository](https://github.com/WICG/uuid/tree/14c29dce221dbd375dde60718c226cad49dbe1e7) to learn more about the incubation.
